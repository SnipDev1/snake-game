# Description
Hello, this is my small console-snake-game on python. 
I have created all basic's mechanics and input from keyboard. 
I tried to create this game, with minimum using other libraries, so I think Iâ€™ve done it.
Enjoyable playing!

## Key bindings:
1) W - Move Up
2) A - Move Left
3) S - Move Down
4) D - Move Right
5) Esc - Quit

## Used libraries:
1) os
2) random
3) sys
4) threading
5) time

## Future plans:
1) Improve render system, because of "PVM"
2) Fix some small bugs
3) Add Lose "screen"

## Installation Guide:
1) Download Python from official site

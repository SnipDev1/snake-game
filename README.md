# Description
Hello, this is my console snake game written in Python. 

The game features all the basic mechanics and input from keyboard. 
I aimed to create this game with minimum usage of external libraries and I believe I have achieved this. 

I hope you enjoy playing it!

## Key bindings:
1) W - Move Up
2) A - Move Left
3) S - Move Down
4) D - Move Right
5) Esc - Quit

## Required libraries:
- os
- random
- sys
- threading
- time
- keyboard

## To Do:
- [ ] Improve the render system to avoid the "PVM" issue
- [ ] Fix any remaining small bugs
- [ ] Add a "lose" screen

## Installation Guide:
1) Download Python(3.11.3) from the official website.
2) Upgrade pip by running the command:
```
pip install --upgrade pip
```
3) Install the "keyboard" library by running the command:
```
pip install keyboard
```
4) To start the game, navigate to the project directory and run the following command:
```
python main.py
```
